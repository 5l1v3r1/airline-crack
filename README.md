## :inbox_tray: &nbsp; How to Install &nbsp; :inbox_tray:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## :fire: &nbsp; How to Run &nbsp; :fire:

***For Mac OS X:***

Open the directory to the file: 'airline-crack' and run the program by typing: 
`sudo python3 airlinecrack.py`

***For Linux:***

Simply type `airline-crack` in your terminal to run the program.

##### Setup Information

During setup for Linux users, the python program will go into the directory: `/usr/share/airline-crack`

As for the bash program that will allow for running the program with the command 'airline-crack' will go to the directory: `/usr/bin`

This however does not work for Mac OS users as the `/usr/bin/` and `/usr/share` ***is not*** accessable even with sudo.
This is because Macs limit the power of the root account, so that even if you become root, you don't have full control over the system.
